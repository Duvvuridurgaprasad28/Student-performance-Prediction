# Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict students' performance in exams based on various features such as study time, past grades, and other academic-related factors. The prediction model uses machine learning algorithms to assess the data and predict student performance with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes the dataset for machine learning models.
- **Model Building**: Builds machine learning models to predict student performance.
- **Streamlit Web App**: A simple interactive web interface built with Streamlit to visualize and predict students' exam performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive charts and visualizations.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Duvvuridurgaprasad28/student-performance-prediction.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Student-performance-prediction
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a local web server and open the app in your default browser.

## Usage

Once the Streamlit app is running, you can:
- Input the features such as study hours, past grades, and other factors.
- Click on the **Predict** button to see the predicted performance of the student in the exam.
- Visualize the data using interactive charts and graphs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various factors that affect student performance, including:

- Name: The student's name.
- Gender: Gender of the student.
- AttendanceRate: The student's attendance percentage.
- StudyHoursPerWeek: The number of hours the student studies each week.
- PreviousGrade: The student's previous exam grade.
- ExtracurricularActivities: Participation in extracurricular activities.
- ParentalSupport: The level of parental support.
